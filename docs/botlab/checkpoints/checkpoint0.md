NOTICE
{: .fs-5 .text-red-200 .fw-500}

1. **Only operate your MBot on the floor.** When your MBot is on a table, put it in a box to make sure it doesn't accidentally drive away and zip off the table!
2. Each student will build their own MBot that they are solely responsible for returning in full functioning condition at the end of the semester.
    - If you believe your MBot is broken, talk with the GSIs for help repairing or replacing parts.
    - Donâ€™t make changes without approval from the course staff. Undo any (approved) changes before you return them.

Failure to adhere to these warnings may result in a penalty to your grade.
