NOTICE
{: .fs-5 .text-red-200 .fw-500}

1. **Only operate your MBot on the floor.** When your MBot is on a table, put it in a box to make sure it doesn't accidentally drive away and zip off the table!
2. Each student will build their own MBot that they are solely responsible for returning in full functioning condition at the end of the semester.
    - If you believe your MBot is broken, talk with the GSIs for help repairing or replacing parts.
    - Don’t make changes without approval from the course staff. Undo any (approved) changes before you return them.

Failure to adhere to these warnings may result in a penalty to your grade.

## Assembly and Setup
### Task 0.1 Assembly
Following the instruction in the [assembly guide](https://mbot.robotics.umich.edu/docs/hardware/classic/assembly) and assemble your robot.

### Task 0.2 Software Setup
Following the instructions in the [mbot system setup guide](/docs/botlab/mbot-system-setup-Pi5) and setup the software on your robot.

By the end of Checkpoint 0, you should have a fully functional MBot that’s ready for development. If you can successfully drive your MBot using the teleoperation keyboard control, then you’ve completed Checkpoint 0.

Finishing Checkpoint 0 is critical. Please reach out during the first week of BotLab if you need any assistance to get your MBot fully functional. BotLab is more intensive than ArmLab, so having your MBot ready early will make a big difference.
